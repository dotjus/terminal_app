DINNING HALL
A crystal chandelier glitters above the dining room, watching over eight empty chairs. The chairs are high-backed and cushioned with velvetâ€”velvet that matches the silken drapes covering the windows. Like the main hall, the walls are ornately carved with elegant images of deer flitting among ancient trees. The table is set, all silverware polished to a dazzling shine. A painting of an alpine vale is mounted above the unlit fireplace. A tapestry depicting nobles hunting wolves from horseback hangs from the wall. This, you see, is privilege at its finest. The Dudley family lives well and lives large.
