You drive along a dirt path for several km's until you take the turn off. You see the house now, you drive through the large iron gates covered in vines and park in the turning circle out the front of the house. As you get out of the car you take a moment to enjoy the enthralling colours of the dwindling sunset. Turning back to the task at hand you notice the house is well lit and looks like people are home.
  
Walking up to the front door you realise it is open. You ring the door bell nothing... your ring it several more times... nothing. You step back and survey the three story manor. In multiple rooms the lights are on, you call out but to no response. Has some one broken in? Are there squatters? Then from the top floor you think you can very faintly hear music. Almost sounds like dance music. Today is Friday and the start of winter break... perhaps its school leavers who decided to throw a not so legal party?... Regardless! Detective Dyer is counting on you. You resolve yourself to get to the bottom of this and enter the manor's main entrance hall.
