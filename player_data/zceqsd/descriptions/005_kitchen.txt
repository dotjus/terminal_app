KITCHEN
The kitchen, gloomy as it might be, is tidy. The shelves are neatly stocked with dishware. The worktable has been wiped clean, a cutting board left behind as the only oversight. The iron pipes of the oven snake out like a willow tree caught in a windstorm, twisting up and into the ceiling. The door to the pantry hangs ajar, and a large hatch is built into the corner of the wall.
