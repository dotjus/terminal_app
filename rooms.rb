    name: "MAIN HALL"
    description: "It's almost breathtaking. In the gloom beyond the foyer, the main hall glitters. Its wood-panelled walls are ornately carved with idyllic scenes of frolicking nymphs. Two heavy wooden doors with brass knobs stand expectantly on either side of the room.  At one end of the hall, a sweeping red-carpeted staircase climbs to unknown heights; at the other is a large black slate fireplace, warm and inviting. Above which a large wooden plaque hangs."
